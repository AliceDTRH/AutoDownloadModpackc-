## Notes:
* This launcher/updater is currently in Beta and it may not always update perfectly.
* The Modpack (selection of mods) has not been picked properly yet and will change significantly over time.
* The Modpack will only launch if there is an internet connection. This will be changed in the future.
* Please report any issues you run into.
* The current version is only compiled for Windows, but compiling it cross-platform for Linux does not seem like a lot of work so let me know if you're interested in that.
* I am not affiliated with the amazing, popular open-source Minecraft Launcher MultiMC.
* All executables made by me can be verified at https://authenticate.codenotary.io/
* The compiled version of the modpack updater requires at least a 64 bits processor/cpu. This because most modpacks require over 4gb of ram anyway.
